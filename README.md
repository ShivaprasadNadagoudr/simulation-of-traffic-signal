# simulation-of-traffic-signal

The  simulation  of  traffic  involves  the  modeling  of  a  complex  system  that   is  open,  shows emergent phenomena,  and  non-linear relationships.  This project  outlines the  ideas involved  in traffic simulation  and reports on  the results of a  traffic simulator designed  to model  congestion amongst  urban  and   suburban  roads.
